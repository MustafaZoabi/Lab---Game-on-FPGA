# üéÆ FPGA Game on DE10-Standard (Intel FPGA) using SystemVerilog

This repository contains the source code and project files for a custom game implemented on the **DE10-Standard FPGA development board** by Intel. The game logic and hardware design are written in **SystemVerilog**, and the project was developed and compiled using **Intel Quartus Prime**.

## üß† Project Overview

This game is a hardware-level implementation that runs entirely on the FPGA, leveraging:

- Real-time input via on-board buttons/switches
- VGA output for video display
- Seven-segment displays and LEDs for game feedback
- Custom finite state machines and datapath components
- No software processor ‚Äî purely RTL design

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Tools

- **FPGA Board:** Terasic DE10-Standard (Cyclone V SoC)
- **Language:** SystemVerilog
- **IDE:** Intel Quartus Prime Lite Edition
- **Simulation:** ModelSim (optional, for functional testing)

## üéÆ Game Features

> _You can update this section with the actual features of your game._

- Real-time interaction using push buttons and switches
- VGA output for displaying game graphics
- Score tracking via 7-segment display
- Reset and pause functionality
- Win/Loss condition handling

How To Run The files---------
Open in Quartus
Launch Intel Quartus Prime
Open the .qpf project file located in quartus_project/
Compile the project (Full Compilation)
Program the FPGA
Connect your DE10-Standard board via USB Blaster

Use Quartus Programmer to load the .sof file located in output_files/ onto the board

‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Play the Game
To play the game:

Simply run the .sof file on the board ‚Äî no need to interact with any other files.

The game starts automatically after programming. Control it using the onboard switches and keyboard.
