# 🎮 FPGA Game on DE10-Standard (Intel FPGA) using SystemVerilog

This repository contains the source code and project files for a custom game implemented on the **DE10-Standard FPGA development board** by Intel. The game logic and hardware design are written in **SystemVerilog**, and the project was developed and compiled using **Intel Quartus Prime**.

## 🧠 Project Overview

This game is a hardware-level implementation that runs entirely on the FPGA, leveraging:

- Real-time input via on-board buttons/switches
- VGA output for video display
- Seven-segment displays and LEDs for game feedback
- Custom finite state machines and datapath components
- No software processor — purely RTL design

## 🛠️ Development Tools

- **FPGA Board:** Terasic DE10-Standard (Cyclone V SoC)
- **Language:** SystemVerilog
- **IDE:** Intel Quartus Prime Lite Edition
- **Simulation:** ModelSim (optional, for functional testing)
